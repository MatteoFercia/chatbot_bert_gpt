To open it, just click with the mouse on the calendar icon.Map: shows you the city map.You don't have to confirm each modification to the filters since the update is automatic.The description of each room includes the location of the apartment. You can visualize it by using the map.In this same section, you will find the main points of interest of the area as well as information like public transport and other services that allow you to make an informed choice.The pictures correspond exactly to reality in most cases. You will see representative photos not corresponding to the room just on some rare occasions.Anyway, Stanza Semplice® adopts the same image quality standard in all Italian cities. That is why every picture is absolutely in line with reality.The photographs were taken using the home staging kit which introduces some decorative elements that are not supplied.Surely! By clicking on the REQUEST INFO button you can get in touch with your Apartment Manager and arrange a visit to the place of interest.In any case, we use the same format in all Italian cities to guarantee a homogeneous quality standard. Our apartments respect the same pattern from Trieste to Messina without distinction of furnishings and quality in terms of renovation.You will need some documents to block a room and complete the reservation. These documents will allow us to prepare all the necessary documentation to formalize the contract.The information and documents requested are essential to register the contract correctly.They are:Fiscal CodeUniversity enrollment, or pre-registration, or valid cardIdentity card, or passport, or driving licenseItalian law requires the unique identification code, also called the tax code, to formalize a lease agreement. Every citizen, whether Italian or foreign, must possess it for tax reasons. That why is essential you have the tax code. Read below how to obtain it: - Through the Revenue Agency You can physically go to an office of the Revenue Agency with identification documents (identity card/passport with visa/residence permit). To avoid wasting time, we recommend calling the local office closest to you to receive confirmation. Depending on the agency of reference,  you will be able to make an appointment or not.No, Stanza Semplice® is not a real estate agency. For this reason, there is no brokerage fee.To get a room, you will have to sustain a one-time expense ranged between € 200 and € 400 depending on the city of reference.During the booking and/or information request phase, your Apartment Manager will provide you the specifications relating to your city.This amount will be used to pay:Annual Club Stanza Semplice® membershipContract registrationCleaning at the end of the leaseRestoration of plaster at the end of the lease50% of the registration taxstampsYou will only have to pay the annual membership of the Stanza Semplice® Club, half registration tax, and the revenue stamps. In this case, the amount is between € 100 and € 200 depending on the city.Please refer to your Apartment Manager for expense details.After booking your room you can agree with your Apartment Manager the date and times for the collection of the keys and instructions for your entry into the room. This operation must be done at least a week in advance, to be able to guarantee the delivery of the room at the times most congenial to you.No, it is important to agree with the Apartment Manager at least a week in advance to define the entry time. For this reason it is very important that you manage to organize yourself well with the timetables of the trains, planes or other transports that you will use to reach the city.In the event that it is not possible for you to reach the place of the appointment in time, inform immediately your Apartment Manager who will indicate the facilities to stay in while waiting for the next appointment for the delivery of the keys.The contract is closely linked to the person who signed it, with legal validity.For this reason, the person who will collect the keys and take over the room cannot be anyone other than the contract holder himself.It is therefore not possible to delegate this process, not even to relatives and family members.It's enough to have an identity document and a tax code.Contracts with Stanza Semplice® are individual. Each tenant has his own contract with his rent; the other rooms do not affect your contractual position in any way.The contracts follow the university cycle and in most cases have a duration of 12 months. However, in some cases, and subject to availability, it will be possible to make contracts of shorter duration.Of course, during the course of your contract you will be able to withdraw from the contract with pre-established notice and for serious reasons. Your Apartment Manager will help you find your replacement right away.Notify your Apartment Manager who will act immediately to find you a replacement as quickly as possible, in order to help you expedite the notice of withdrawal from the contract. This cannot be guaranteed as it depends on many factors and variables, but we will do what we can to help you.If you prefer to view the room before booking it, you can contact the Apartment Manager directly.To contact him, enter the menu of the chosen room and fill out the form on request info. Alternatively, you can find the reference contacts at the top of the room menu.Where present you can view virtual tours and videos of the apartments, in this way you can realize the spaces and environments in a realistic way.If you have found the right room for you, we suggest you book it online immediately.
